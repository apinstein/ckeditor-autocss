The "autocss" plugin will copy all css from the host page into the editor via editor.config.contentsCSS.

This is great for making ckeditor truly WYSIWYG for complex css environments.

Plugin has sizzle included inline; if your site already uses jQuery, prototype, etc, you could save room by removing it and switching the selector syntax to your js lib.
